Unity official example implemented with [ToLua#](https://github.com/topameng/tolua)

# Git for Windows?
please make sure you run git with **administrator rights**, as this repo contains [symlink](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5917249/git-symlinks-in-windows#answer-42137273).
if Assets/3rd/tolua(the symlink) appears like a file after clone, delete it and do "git reset --hard" with administrator rights.
